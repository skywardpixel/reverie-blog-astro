# AI Development Guidelines

## Git Commit/Push Policy

**CRITICAL**: Never commit or push changes without explicit user confirmation. This includes:

- `git commit` commands
- `git push` commands
- Any git operations that modify the repository history

## Process for Git Operations

When code changes are complete:
1. Show the user what changes will be committed
2. Ask for explicit permission to commit and push
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Only then execute git commands

## Documentation Creation Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create additional markdown documentation files (*.md) without explicit user approval. This includes:

- README files
- Documentation in `/docs` folders
- Tutorial or guide files
- Example or sample documentation
- Any explanatory markdown content

## Exceptions

The following are acceptable without approval:
- Code files (.js, .ts, .astro, .css, etc.)
- Configuration files (.json, .yaml, etc.)
- Sample content files that are part of the main application functionality
- Test files

## Rationale

Documentation should be intentional and user-directed to:
- Avoid cluttering the project with unnecessary files
- Ensure documentation aligns with user preferences
- Maintain project organization standards
- Prevent documentation drift and maintenance overhead

## Process

When documentation would be helpful:
1. Suggest the documentation need to the user
2. Wait for explicit approval
3. Only then create the documentation file(s)

This guideline helps maintain a clean, purposeful project structure.
