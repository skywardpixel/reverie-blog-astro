Welcome to a quick showcase of what MDX can do! This post demonstrates various Markdown and MDX syntax features you can use in your blog.

## Headings

You can easily create headings from H1 to H6.

# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H3

#### This is an H4

##### This is an H5

###### This is an H6

## Paragraphs and Basic Text Formatting

Here's a standard paragraph of text. You can use **bold** text, _italic_ text, or even **_bold and italic_** text.

You can also `highlight code inline` using backticks.

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item A
  - Nested item B
- Item three

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Sub-item 1
   2. Sub-item 2
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are fantastic for displaying larger snippets of code.

```javascript
// Function to add two numbers
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

```python
# Python example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("MDX User")
print(message)
```

## Blockquotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
> â€” Steve Jobs

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> It can span several lines and is great for highlighting important text or quotes.

## Horizontal Rule

---

A horizontal rule can be used to separate content visually.

## Links

Here's a [link to Astro](https://astro.build) and a [link to GitHub](https://github.com).

## Images

While we removed hero images, you can still embed images within your post content like this:

```
![A tranquil forest path.](/images/example-forest.jpg)
```

_(Note: I'm not actually creating the image file, this is just for demonstration purposes.)_

## MDX in Action

MDX allows you to embed JSX directly within your Markdown. For instance, if you had a custom React or Svelte component, you could import and use it here.

```jsx
import MyCustomComponent from '../components/MyCustomComponent.astro';

<MyCustomComponent prop1="value" />;
```

_(Note: No actual component is being imported or used in this static post for simplicity, but this is how you'd do it!)_

This showcases the basic building blocks available in MDX. Enjoy writing your posts!
