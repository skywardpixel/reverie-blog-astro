2023 has finally passed. Due to its particularly dismal nature, after multiple
attempts, I've decided to forego a year-end summary and instead write about my
outlook for 2024. I recently saw a tweet that encouraged envisioning what kind
of person you want to be in five years and then striving each day of this year
toward that goal. So, what do I want to be doing five years from now?

## Becoming an "Independent" Developer

I'm undecided about whether I'll still be "working" in five years. I don't
dislike my current job, but I often find myself wishing for more freedom in
allocating my time. I follow many independent developers on Twitter (like the
creators of Panda Eating Messages and OpenCat,
[@waylybaye](https://twitter.com/waylybaye)), and I often listen to independent
developers discuss their experiences on Podcasts. I have many independent apps
on my phone and computer, many of which are simple, useful, and unique. I also
want to create my own apps but often feel that I lack original ideas, frequently
thinking, "someone has probably already done this." This falls within the realm
of product management, and as an independent developer, I would have to be my
own product manager. Perhaps "micro-innovations" based on existing apps are
feasible. I think I need to better understand existing products to gain more
inspiration.

In addition to independent iOS development, I've always wanted to develop
independent games. After playing [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/),
I've wanted to create a similar Metroidvania game, but I feel overwhelmed every
time I open Unity. Independent game development means taking on multiple roles
like game design, music, art, programming, etc., a significant challenge for
beginners. The good news is that the advent of generative AI has made this
somewhat easier. As a developer, my art skills are rather weak. Even in my
expertise area, programming, I'm not well-versed in the design patterns and
algorithms often encountered in game development.

Besides hard skills, all these "independent" roles require soft skills such as
self-marketing, socializing, and time management. I believe I have a lot to
learn in this area, but first, I need to produce something.

## The Path to Financial "Freedom" (FIRE)

While I don't dislike "working" and wouldn't mind doing some sort of 'job' into
my forties or fifties, I would like to work purely out of interest and not feel
pressured even in the event of layoffs. Becoming an independent developer is one
aspect of this, and investing is another.

I've been working for about two years and, admittedly, I haven't saved much. My
income isn't low, but most of it goes towards my mortgage, food, and travel.
While I don't think this is terribly wrong (money is meant to be spent, after
all), I also feel it's better to save for the future.

I've recently started using [Copilot](https://copilot.money/), an AI-powered
expense tracking app, which I find more convenient than YNAB. I think I should
more strictly control my expenses, review my bills daily, and correct any
unreasonable spending promptly. After saving money, I also want to try more
active investments, buying some funds and stocks, and continue investing in VOO.

## "Health" and Appearance

I've never managed my "physique" well since high school. I'm not a sports
enthusiast, I love to eat, and often lack sleep, leading to an undesirable body
shape; my weight especially skyrocketed during the pandemic, making body and
appearance anxiety my greatest source of insecurity.

Besides my physique, I have some other health issues. I think I should more
actively seek treatment instead of continually delaying it.

Beyond health, there are many other areas I want to improve, such as posture,
dressing, hairstyle, etc. I believe these aspects will improve as I work on my
physique, but it will require my own effort. Above all, I want to smile more
confidently and beautifully and have a brighter and more pleasant voice when
speaking or singing. I might seek professional coaching or practice more on my
own.

## Setting Goals

To work towards these objectives, I need to set some more specific goals for 2024.

What I'm thinking of:

- **Skills for Independent App Development**
  - Learn product design, think more about ideas, and record my thoughts.
  - Learn iOS development (mainly Swift UI).
- **Skills for Independent Game Development**
  - In art, learn Blender and Photoshop, and master AI generative tools more
    proficiently. Practice sketching and creating.
  - In design, learn and think about game design.
  - In programming, practice remaking classic games and master tools like Unity.
- **Financial Management**
  - Control expenses, review bills and budget daily.
  - Invest at least 30% of my income each month.
  - Actively look for investment opportunities.
- **Physique and Health**
  - Exercise for at least 30 minutes in the morning and evening, and continue
    swimming and playing tennis twice a week.
  - Ensure at least 7 hours of sleep each day.
  - Avoid takeout, snacks, and sugary drinks.
- **Appearance Management**
  - Find professional coaching for posture correction, facial expression
    management, and voice training.
  - Review my dressing style monthly and buy new clothes.

Here's to hoping 2024 can be a good start.
